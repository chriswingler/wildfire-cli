# 🔥 Discord Wildfire MMORPG - Standalone Bot Deployment

## ⚡ Quick Start - Choose Your Deployment

### 🔥 Option 1: DigitalOcean App Platform (Recommended - 2 Minutes)

**One-Command Cloud Deployment:**
```bash
# Deploy directly from GitHub to DigitalOcean cloud
./deploy.sh
```

**What it does:**
- ✅ Deploys from your GitHub repo automatically
- ✅ Sets up 24/7 hosting on DigitalOcean ($5/month)
- ✅ Handles scaling and updates automatically
- ✅ Professional production environment

### 🖥️ Option 2: Local Development (5 Minutes)

**Run locally for testing:**
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# 2. Configure bot token
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your Discord bot token

# 3. Run locally
python src/main.py
```

## 🔧 DigitalOcean Setup Details

### Prerequisites
1. **GitHub Account**: Your code repository
2. **DigitalOcean Account**: Sign up at digitalocean.com
3. **Discord Bot**: Create at discord.com/developers/applications

### Deployment Steps
```bash
# 1. Clone your repo (if not already)
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/wildfire-cli
cd wildfire-cli

# 2. Run deployment script
./deploy.sh

# 3. Add Discord token in DigitalOcean dashboard
# Go to: https://cloud.digitalocean.com/apps
# Add DISCORD_TOKEN in Environment Variables
```

### After Deployment
- **Bot URL**: Visible in DigitalOcean Apps dashboard
- **Logs**: `doctl apps logs YOUR_APP_ID --type run`
- **Cost**: ~$5/month for basic tier
- **Scaling**: Automatic based on usage

## 🎮 Test Commands
In your Discord server:
- `/fire` - Creates a new wildfire incident
- `/respond` - Join the fire response team  
- `/firestatus` - Check status of all active fires

## 🎮 How It Works

### Basic Gameplay Loop
1. **Someone uses `/fire`** → New wildfire incident created
2. **Players use `/respond`** → Join the firefighting team
3. **Use `/firestatus`** → See fire containment progress
4. **More responders = faster containment**

### Simple Mechanics
- **Fire Properties**: Type (grass/forest/interface), size, threat level
- **Player Roles**: Everyone starts as "firefighter"
- **Containment**: Increases based on number of responders (15% per responder)
- **Status Updates**: Real-time progress tracking

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Following Coding Standards
- ✅ Functions under 60 lines
- ✅ Single responsibility principle  
- ✅ Descriptive naming conventions
- ✅ Simple error handling
- ✅ KISS principle implementation
- ✅ YAGNI - only essential dependencies

### Data Storage
- **SQLite Database**: Persistent game state across bot restarts
- **Async Operations**: Non-blocking database operations
- **Multi-Server**: Independent game states per Discord server
- **Scalable**: Ready for UEMini backend integration

### Discord Integration
- **Slash Commands**: Modern Discord command interface
- **Rich Embeds**: Professional information display with color coding
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in cooldown management
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception handling and logging

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Enhancements (Today)
1. **Persistence**: Add SQLite database for fire state
2. **Timers**: Automatic fire progression over time
3. **Roles**: Different firefighter specializations
4. **Channels**: Separate channels for different incidents

### Medium Term (This Week)
1. **Advanced Simulation**: Integrate with fire spread algorithm
2. **Weather System**: Dynamic conditions affecting fires
3. **Resource Management**: Equipment and cost tracking
4. **Player Progression**: XP and advancement system

### Long Term (This Month)
1. **UEMini Integration**: Professional game engine backend
2. **Multi-Server**: Independent game states per Discord server
3. **MMORPG Features**: Guilds, rankings, competitions
4. **Cross-Platform**: Link to main Unreal game development

## 🎯 Success Metrics

### Today's Goals
- [ ] `/fire` command working in Discord
- [ ] Players can `/respond` to incidents  
- [ ] `/firestatus` shows progress
