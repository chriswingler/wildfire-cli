This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Wildfire CLI is a text-based wildfire incident commander simulation game that teaches real-world firefighting tactics and decision-making using authentic Incident Command System (ICS) protocols.

## Key Design Principles

### No Visual Fire Grid
- **Critical**: The game uses internal grid simulation but NEVER displays it visually
- All fire information is communicated through realistic incident reports only
- Fire data is converted from internal cellular automata to professional text reports
- Players receive radio-style reports about fire conditions and resource status

### Authentic Incident Command
- Game follows real ICS operational period structure (12-24 hour cycles)
- Uses authentic wildfire terminology and radio communication style
- Decisions based on real firefighting tactics and resource deployment
- Educational content teaches actual emergency management principles

### Text-Only Interface
- Professional terminal UI using Rich library for colors and formatting
- No ASCII art or visual representations of the fire
- Focus on decision-making through text-based situation reports
- Multiple choice tactical decisions with realistic consequences

## Development Workflow

### Agile Process (Claude-Managed)
- **Sprints**: 2-week cycles with adaptive capacity (16-25 story points proven)
- **Planning**: Claude manages GitHub issues with story points, epics, and sprint planning
- **Reviews**: Claude provides sprint retrospectives with velocity analysis
- **Testing**: >90% code coverage required, emphasis on fire simulation accuracy
- **PM Leadership**: Claude acts as Product Manager using GitHub CLI for project coordination

### Issue Management (Claude-Driven)
- **Claude creates and manages** user stories, bugs, epics with proper formatting
- **Automated sprint planning** with capacity analysis and risk assessment
- **Dynamic scope adjustment** based on technical implementation discoveries
- **Real-time project updates** through GitHub CLI issue management
- **Epic breakdown** by Claude into manageable user stories with dependencies
- **Velocity tracking** across sprints with burndown analysis

### Sprint History & Velocity
- **Sprint 1**: Foundation - Discord bot basics (completed)
- **Sprint 2**: Singleplayer DM Mode - 16 story points (completed) 
- **Sprint 3**: Core Simulation Engine - 25+ story points (‚úÖ MAJOR SUCCESS)
- **Sprint 4**: Singleplayer UX Excellence - 20 story points (üîÑ REPRIORITIZED)
- **Sprint 5**: Enhanced Multiplayer - 20 story points (planned)
- **Average Velocity**: 25+ story points per sprint (significantly exceeded estimates)

### Sprint 4 Reprioritization (Critical UX Fix)
**Problem Identified:** Sprint 3 delivered excellent technical foundation but poor user experience
- ‚ùå Code blocks instead of rich Discord embeds
- ‚ùå Information dumps vs progressive learning
- ‚ùå No interactive decision buttons
- ‚ùå Turn-based vs real-time incident feel

**Sprint 4 Solution:** Singleplayer UX Excellence (Issues #22, #23, #24)
- üéÆ Discord Interactive Interface (6 pts) - Rich embeds & decision buttons
- üéì Rookie Commander Tutorial (6 pts) - Integrated learning experience  
- ‚ö° Real-time Game Feel (6 pts) - Dynamic fire progression
- üìã Multiplayer Foundation (2 pts) - Architecture planning for Sprint 5

**Epic #20 Deferred:** Enhanced Multiplayer moved to Sprint 5 after UX foundation complete

## Wiki Submodule Integration

### **GitHub Wiki as Submodule**
The project uses the GitHub wiki as a Git submodule for automatic development documentation management:

```bash
# Wiki submodule setup (completed)
git submodule add https://github.com/chriswingler/wildfire-cli.wiki.git wiki
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### **Submodule Workflow**
**Developer workflow integrates wiki updates with code changes:**

```bash
# Working with wiki submodule (automatic management)
cd wildfire-cli/
# Edit both code and wiki/ documentation
git add src/ wiki/
git commit -m "Feature implementation + wiki update"
git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand
# Both main repo and wiki automatically updated
```

### **Wiki Content Organization**
**Internal development documentation structure:**
- **[Home](wiki/Home.md)** - Development dashboard with current sprint status
- **[Sprint Planning](wiki/Sprint-Planning.md)** - PM workflows and sprint ceremonies  
- **[Kanban Workflow](wiki/Kanban-Workflow.md)** - GitHub project board usage and labels
- **[Technical Architecture](wiki/Technical-Architecture.md)** - System design and technical decisions
- **[Development Standards](wiki/Development-Standards.md)** - Code quality standards and conventions
- **[Troubleshooting](wiki/Troubleshooting.md)** - Common development issues and solutions
- **[Velocity Analysis](wiki/Velocity-Analysis.md)** - Sprint metrics and capacity planning
- **[Deployment Guide](wiki/Deployment-Guide.md)** - Production deployment workflows

### **Benefits of Submodule Approach**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic wiki management** - No separate workflows needed
- ‚úÖ **Version synchronization** - Wiki and code stay in sync
- ‚úÖ **GitHub web interface** - Still accessible via GitHub wiki UI
- ‚úÖ **PM integration** - Wiki updates part of sprint workflow

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow coding standards in `docs/coding_standards.md`
- Keep functions small (max 60 lines) with single responsibility
- Use descriptive names following wildfire/ICS terminology
- Comment complex fire behavior algorithms and decision logic

## Core Components

### Discord Bot Integration (`src/discord_wildfire.py`) 
**Sprint 2 Implementation - Singleplayer DM Mode**

#### Context-Aware Command System
- **DM Detection**: Commands automatically detect DM vs Guild context using `interaction.guild is None`
- **Dual Mode Support**: Same commands (`/fire`, `/respond`, `/firestatus`) work differently in each context
- **Clean Routing**: Separate handler functions for singleplayer vs multiplayer modes

#### Singleplayer Game Engine (`SingleplayerGame` class)
- **User Isolation**: Personal game state completely separate from multiplayer
- **Personal Fires**: Individual fire incidents with unique IDs (`personal_{user_id}_{timestamp}`)
- **Solo Progress**: Independent containment and response tracking per user
- **State Management**: Per-user fire tracking and assignment handling

#### Debug Controls (DM-only commands)
- `/clear` - Reset all personal game state for testing/development
- `/start` - Begin new singleplayer scenario session
- `/stop` - End current session cleanly with summary
- **Context Protection**: Debug commands only work in DM context

#### Commands Available
- `/fire` - Create wildfire incident (context-aware: personal vs guild)
- `/respond` - Join incident response (context-aware: solo vs team)  
- `/firestatus` - Check incident status (context-aware: personal vs guild fires)
- `/clear` - Reset personal state (DM only)
- `/start` - Begin new session (DM only)
- `/stop` - End session (DM only)

### Fire Simulation Engine (`src/game/fire_grid.py`)
- Internal 6x6 or 8x8 cellular automata grid (never displayed)
- Terrain types: Forest, Grass, Urban, Ridge, Valley
- Weather effects: wind direction/speed, humidity, temperature
- Fire states: Empty, Burning, Burned, Contained
- Realistic spread rates based on fuel type and conditions

### Resource Management (`src/game/resources.py`)
- Hand Crews: 20 firefighters, high mobility, all terrain
- Helitack: 8 firefighters + helicopter, weather dependent
- Air Tankers: 2,400 gal retardant, create firebreaks
- Dozers: Build fire lines, terrain limited
- Engines: Structure protection, road access required

### Game Loop (`src/game/game_state.py`)
- Turn-based operational periods (12-24 hours)
- ICS planning cycle: briefing ‚Üí objectives ‚Üí strategy ‚Üí allocation ‚Üí implementation
- Win/loss conditions based on acres burned, structures saved, safety record
- Random events: weather changes, equipment failures, spot fires

### UI Components (`src/ui/`)
- Rich Panel: Incident reports with color coding
- Rich Table: Resource status and availability
- Rich Prompt: Multiple choice tactical decisions
- Report generation: Convert grid state to authentic text reports
