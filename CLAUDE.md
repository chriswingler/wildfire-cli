## Project Overview

Wildfire CLI is a text-based wildfire incident commander simulation game that teaches real-world firefighting tactics and decision-making using authentic Incident Command System (ICS) protocols.

## Key Design Principles

### No Visual Fire Grid
- **Critical**: The game uses internal grid simulation but NEVER displays it visually
- All fire information is communicated through realistic incident reports only
- Fire data is converted from internal cellular automata to professional text reports
- Players receive radio-style reports about fire conditions and resource status

### Authentic Incident Command
- Game follows real ICS operational period structure (12-24 hour cycles)
- Uses authentic wildfire terminology and radio communication style
- Decisions based on real firefighting tactics and resource deployment
- Educational content teaches actual emergency management principles

### Text-Only Interface
- Professional terminal UI using Rich library for colors and formatting
- No ASCII art or visual representations of the fire
- Focus on decision-making through text-based situation reports
- Multiple choice tactical decisions with realistic consequences

## Development Workflow

### Agile Process
- **Sprints**: 2-week cycles with 10-13 story points capacity
- **Planning**: Use GitHub Projects with custom fields for story points, epics, priorities
- **Reviews**: Focus on educational value and authentic ICS protocols
- **Testing**: >90% code coverage required, emphasis on fire simulation accuracy

### Issue Management
- Use provided issue templates for user stories, bugs, epics
- All features must include acceptance criteria and story point estimates
- Tag issues with appropriate epic labels (ðŸ”¥ Fire Engine, ðŸŽ® Game Loop, etc.)
- Follow Definition of Done checklist for all work

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow coding standards in `docs/coding_standards.md`
- Keep functions small (max 60 lines) with single responsibility
- Use descriptive names following wildfire/ICS terminology
- Comment complex fire behavior algorithms and decision logic

## Core Components

### Discord Bot Integration (`src/discord_wildfire.py`) 
**Sprint 2 Implementation - Singleplayer DM Mode**

#### Context-Aware Command System
- **DM Detection**: Commands automatically detect DM vs Guild context using `interaction.guild is None`
- **Dual Mode Support**: Same commands (`/fire`, `/respond`, `/firestatus`) work differently in each context
- **Clean Routing**: Separate handler functions for singleplayer vs multiplayer modes

#### Singleplayer Game Engine (`SingleplayerGame` class)
- **User Isolation**: Personal game state completely separate from multiplayer
- **Personal Fires**: Individual fire incidents with unique IDs (`personal_{user_id}_{timestamp}`)
- **Solo Progress**: Independent containment and response tracking per user
- **State Management**: Per-user fire tracking and assignment handling

#### Debug Controls (DM-only commands)
- `/clear` - Reset all personal game state for testing/development
- `/start` - Begin new singleplayer scenario session
- `/stop` - End current session cleanly with summary
- **Context Protection**: Debug commands only work in DM context

#### Commands Available
- `/fire` - Create wildfire incident (context-aware: personal vs guild)
- `/respond` - Join incident response (context-aware: solo vs team)  
- `/firestatus` - Check incident status (context-aware: personal vs guild fires)
- `/clear` - Reset personal state (DM only)
- `/start` - Begin new session (DM only)
- `/stop` - End session (DM only)

### Fire Simulation Engine (`src/game/fire_grid.py`)
- Internal 6x6 or 8x8 cellular automata grid (never displayed)
- Terrain types: Forest, Grass, Urban, Ridge, Valley
- Weather effects: wind direction/speed, humidity, temperature
- Fire states: Empty, Burning, Burned, Contained
- Realistic spread rates based on fuel type and conditions

### Resource Management (`src/game/resources.py`)
- Hand Crews: 20 firefighters, high mobility, all terrain
- Helitack: 8 firefighters + helicopter, weather dependent
- Air Tankers: 2,400 gal retardant, create firebreaks
- Dozers: Build fire lines, terrain limited
- Engines: Structure protection, road access required

### Game Loop (`src/game/game_state.py`)
- Turn-based operational periods (12-24 hours)
- ICS planning cycle: briefing â†’ objectives â†’ strategy â†’ allocation â†’ implementation
- Win/loss conditions based on acres burned, structures saved, safety record
- Random events: weather changes, equipment failures, spot fires

### UI Components (`src/ui/`)
- Rich Panel: Incident reports with color coding
- Rich Table: Resource status and availability
- Rich Prompt: Multiple choice tactical decisions
- Report generation: Convert grid state to authentic text reports

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Fire spread algorithm accuracy
- Resource deployment effectiveness calculations
- Game state transitions and persistence
- Report generation from simulation data

### Integration Tests
- Complete operational period cycles
- Multi-turn scenario progression
- UI component integration
- Save/load game state functionality

### Educational Testing
- Verify authentic ICS terminology usage
- Validate fire behavior realism
- Test learning objective achievement
- Review tactical decision consequences
