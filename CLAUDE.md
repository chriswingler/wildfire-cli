# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Wildfire CLI is a text-based wildfire incident commander simulation game that teaches real-world firefighting tactics and decision-making using authentic Incident Command System (ICS) protocols.

## Key Design Principles

### No Visual Fire Grid
- **Critical**: The game uses internal grid simulation but NEVER displays it visually
- All fire information is communicated through realistic incident reports only
- Fire data is converted from internal cellular automata to professional text reports
- Players receive radio-style reports about fire conditions and resource status

### Authentic Incident Command
- Game follows real ICS operational period structure (12-24 hour cycles)
- Uses authentic wildfire terminology and radio communication style
- Decisions based on real firefighting tactics and resource deployment
- Educational content teaches actual emergency management principles

### Text-Only Interface
- Professional terminal UI using Rich library for colors and formatting
- No ASCII art or visual representations of the fire
- Focus on decision-making through text-based situation reports
- Multiple choice tactical decisions with realistic consequences

## Development Workflow

### Agile Process (Claude-Managed)
- **Sprints**: 2-week cycles with adaptive capacity (16-25 story points proven)
- **Planning**: Claude manages GitHub issues with story points, epics, and sprint planning
- **Reviews**: Claude provides sprint retrospectives with velocity analysis
- **Testing**: >90% code coverage required, emphasis on fire simulation accuracy
- **PM Leadership**: Claude acts as Product Manager using GitHub CLI for project coordination

### Issue Management (Claude-Driven)
- **Claude creates and manages** user stories, bugs, epics with proper formatting
- **Automated sprint planning** with capacity analysis and risk assessment
- **Dynamic scope adjustment** based on technical implementation discoveries
- **Real-time project updates** through GitHub CLI issue management
- **Epic breakdown** by Claude into manageable user stories with dependencies
- **Velocity tracking** across sprints with burndown analysis

### Sprint History & Velocity
- **Sprint 1**: Foundation - Discord bot basics (completed)
- **Sprint 2**: Singleplayer DM Mode - 16 story points (completed) 
- **Sprint 3**: Core Simulation Engine - 25+ story points (‚úÖ MAJOR SUCCESS)
- **Sprint 4**: Singleplayer UX Excellence - 20 story points (üîÑ REPRIORITIZED)
- **Sprint 5**: Enhanced Multiplayer - 20 story points (planned)
- **Average Velocity**: 25+ story points per sprint (significantly exceeded estimates)

### Sprint 4 Reprioritization (Critical UX Fix)
**Problem Identified:** Sprint 3 delivered excellent technical foundation but poor user experience
- ‚ùå Code blocks instead of rich Discord embeds
- ‚ùå Information dumps vs progressive learning
- ‚ùå No interactive decision buttons
- ‚ùå Turn-based vs real-time incident feel

**Sprint 4 Solution:** Singleplayer UX Excellence (Issues #22, #23, #24)
- üéÆ Discord Interactive Interface (6 pts) - Rich embeds & decision buttons
- üéì Rookie Commander Tutorial (6 pts) - Integrated learning experience  
- ‚ö° Real-time Game Feel (6 pts) - Dynamic fire progression
- üìã Multiplayer Foundation (2 pts) - Architecture planning for Sprint 5

**Epic #20 Deferred:** Enhanced Multiplayer moved to Sprint 5 after UX foundation complete

## Wiki Submodule Integration

### **GitHub Wiki as Submodule**
The project uses the GitHub wiki as a Git submodule for automatic development documentation management:

```bash
# Wiki submodule setup (completed)
git submodule add https://github.com/chriswingler/wildfire-cli.wiki.git wiki
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### **Submodule Workflow**
**Developer workflow integrates wiki updates with code changes:**

```bash
# Working with wiki submodule (automatic management)
cd wildfire-cli/
# Edit both code and wiki/ documentation
git add src/ wiki/
git commit -m "Feature implementation + wiki update"
git push --recurse-submodules=on-demand
# Both main repo and wiki automatically updated
```

### **Wiki Content Organization**
**Internal development documentation structure:**
- **[Home](wiki/Home.md)** - Development dashboard with current sprint status
- **[Sprint Planning](wiki/Sprint-Planning.md)** - PM workflows and sprint ceremonies  
- **[Kanban Workflow](wiki/Kanban-Workflow.md)** - GitHub project board usage and labels
- **[Technical Architecture](wiki/Technical-Architecture.md)** - System design and technical decisions
- **[Development Standards](wiki/Development-Standards.md)** - Code quality standards and conventions
- **[Troubleshooting](wiki/Troubleshooting.md)** - Common development issues and solutions
- **[Velocity Analysis](wiki/Velocity-Analysis.md)** - Sprint metrics and capacity planning
- **[Deployment Guide](wiki/Deployment-Guide.md)** - Production deployment workflows

### **Benefits of Submodule Approach**
- ‚úÖ **Automatic wiki management** - No separate workflows needed
- ‚úÖ **Version synchronization** - Wiki and code stay in sync
- ‚úÖ **GitHub web interface** - Still accessible via GitHub wiki UI
- ‚úÖ **PM integration** - Wiki updates part of sprint workflow
- ‚úÖ **Full version control** - Complete Git workflow for documentation

### Sprint 3 Major Achievements

- **üéÆ Enhanced Singleplayer Experience** - Complete wildfire training scenarios
- **üîß Global Command Sync** - Fixed DM command functionality for OAuth scopes
- **üöÄ Production Deployment** - Bot operational with clean logging

### Code Quality Standards
- Follow coding standards in `docs/coding_standards.md`
- Keep functions small (max 60 lines) with single responsibility
- Use descriptive names following wildfire/ICS terminology
- Comment complex fire behavior algorithms and decision logic

## Core Components

### Discord Bot Integration (`src/discord_wildfire.py`) 
**Sprint 2 Implementation - Singleplayer DM Mode**

#### Context-Aware Command System
- **DM Detection**: Commands automatically detect DM vs Guild context using `interaction.guild is None`
- **Dual Mode Support**: Same commands (`/fire`, `/respond`, `/firestatus`) work differently in each context
- **Clean Routing**: Separate handler functions for singleplayer vs multiplayer modes

#### Singleplayer Game Engine (`SingleplayerGame` class)
- **User Isolation**: Personal game state completely separate from multiplayer
- **Personal Fires**: Individual fire incidents with unique IDs (`personal_{user_id}_{timestamp}`)
- **Solo Progress**: Independent containment and response tracking per user
- **State Management**: Per-user fire tracking and assignment handling

#### Debug Controls (DM-only commands)
- `/clear` - Reset all personal game state for testing/development
- `/start` - Begin new singleplayer scenario session
- `/stop` - End current session cleanly with summary
- **Context Protection**: Debug commands only work in DM context

#### Commands Available
- `/fire` - Create wildfire incident (context-aware: personal vs guild)
- `/respond` - Join incident response (context-aware: solo vs team)  
- `/firestatus` - Check incident status (context-aware: personal vs guild fires)
- `/clear` - Reset personal state (DM only)
- `/start` - Begin new session (DM only)
- `/stop` - End session (DM only)

### Fire Simulation Engine (`src/game/fire_grid.py`)
- Internal 6x6 or 8x8 cellular automata grid (never displayed)
- Terrain types: Forest, Grass, Urban, Ridge, Valley
- Weather effects: wind direction/speed, humidity, temperature
- Fire states: Empty, Burning, Burned, Contained
- Realistic spread rates based on fuel type and conditions

### Resource Management (`src/game/resources.py`)
- Hand Crews: 20 firefighters, high mobility, all terrain
- Helitack: 8 firefighters + helicopter, weather dependent
- Air Tankers: 2,400 gal retardant, create firebreaks
- Dozers: Build fire lines, terrain limited
- Engines: Structure protection, road access required

### Game Loop (`src/game/game_state.py`)
- Turn-based operational periods (12-24 hours)
- ICS planning cycle: briefing ‚Üí objectives ‚Üí strategy ‚Üí allocation ‚Üí implementation
- Win/loss conditions based on acres burned, structures saved, safety record
- Random events: weather changes, equipment failures, spot fires

### UI Components (`src/ui/`)
- Rich Panel: Incident reports with color coding
- Rich Table: Resource status and availability
- Rich Prompt: Multiple choice tactical decisions
- Report generation: Convert grid state to authentic text reports

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Fire spread algorithm accuracy
- Resource deployment effectiveness calculations
- Game state transitions and persistence
- Report generation from simulation data

### Integration Tests
- Complete operational period cycles
- Multi-turn scenario progression
- UI component integration
- Save/load game state functionality

### Educational Testing
- Verify authentic ICS terminology usage
- Validate fire behavior realism
- Test learning objective achievement
- Review tactical decision consequences

### GitHub Project Board Creation & Management

**Repository-Level Project Setup (Completed):**
- **Project:** Wildfire CLI Kanban Board (Project #5)
- **URL:** https://github.com/users/chriswingler/projects/5
- **Repository Link:** ‚úÖ Confirmed appearing in wildfire-cli/projects tab

**GitHub CLI Commands for Repository Projects:**
```bash
# Create repository-linked project
gh project create --owner chriswingler --title "Project Name"

# Link project to repository (critical for repo Projects tab visibility)
gh project link PROJECT_NUMBER --owner chriswingler --repo chriswingler/wildfire-cli

# Add issues to project
gh project item-add PROJECT_NUMBER --owner chriswingler --url https://github.com/chriswingler/wildfire-cli/issues/ISSUE_NUMBER

# List projects for user
gh project list --owner chriswingler

# View project details
gh project view PROJECT_NUMBER --owner chriswingler

# Verify repository integration via GraphQL
gh api graphql -f query='{ repository(owner: "chriswingler", name: "wildfire-cli") { projectsV2(first: 10) { nodes { id number title url } } } }'
```

**Key Lessons Learned:**
1. **GitHub Projects V2 are user/org-level** by default, not repository-level
2. **Repository linking is separate step** - use `gh project link` command
3. **User projects don't appear in repo Projects tab** without explicit linking
4. **GraphQL createProjectV2 with repository node ID fails** - use GitHub CLI instead
5. **GitHub CLI project commands are more reliable** than direct GraphQL for repo integration

**Project Management Workflow:**
```bash
# Complete repository project setup workflow
PROJECT_NUM=$(gh project create --owner chriswingler --title "New Project" --format json | jq -r '.number')
gh project link $PROJECT_NUM --owner chriswingler --repo chriswingler/wildfire-cli
gh project item-add $PROJECT_NUM --owner chriswingler --url https://github.com/chriswingler/wildfire-cli/issues/ISSUE_NUM
```

**Current Active Project:**
- **Project #5:** Wildfire CLI Kanban Board
- **Issues Added:** Sprint 4 (#22, #23, #24), Epic #20, completed items

#### GitHub Project Kanban Board Structure
**Claude has set up a comprehensive GitHub project with kanban workflow for visual project management:**

**Work Stream Labels (for categorization):**
- `area: ui-ux` - User interface and experience work stream
- `area: game-engine` - Core game logic and simulation work stream  
- `area: content` - Game content and scenarios work stream
- `area: infrastructure` - Architecture, deployment, and tooling work stream

**Status Labels (for kanban workflow):**
- `status: todo` - Ready to start work (purple)
- `status: in-progress` - Currently being worked on (yellow)
- `status: review` - Code review or testing needed (orange)
- `status: done` - Completed and deployed (green)

**Iteration Labels (for sprint grouping):**
- `iteration: current` - Current sprint (Sprint 4)
- `iteration: next` - Next sprint (Sprint 5)  
- `iteration: future` - Future sprint planning

**GitHub Project Board Views:**
1. **Main Board View** - Grouped by work streams for quick categorization
2. **Sprint Board View** - Grouped by iterations for sprint planning
3. **Kanban Board View** - Grouped by status for workflow management
4. **Feature Focus View** - Filter by user-story label for feature work

**Project Board Usage:**
```bash
# Add work stream and status labels to issues
gh issue edit 22 --add-label "area: ui-ux,status: todo,iteration: current"

# Move items through kanban workflow
gh issue edit 22 --remove-label "status: todo" --add-label "status: in-progress"

# Sprint planning with iteration management
gh issue edit 20 --add-label "iteration: next" --milestone "Sprint 5"

# Quick issue creation with proper categorization
gh issue create --title "New Feature" --label "user-story,area: ui-ux,status: todo"
```

**Kanban Workflow Process:**
1. **New Issues** ‚Üí `status: todo` (ready for sprint planning)
2. **Sprint Planning** ‚Üí Assign to iteration and work stream
3. **Development** ‚Üí Move to `status: in-progress` 
4. **Code Review** ‚Üí Move to `status: review`
5. **Completed** ‚Üí Move to `status: done` and close issue

### Dynamic Kanban Management Rules - MANDATORY FOR CLAUDE

**CRITICAL: Claude MUST actively manage the kanban board during ALL work sessions**

#### Core Board Management Requirements
- **Real-time Updates**: Update ticket status immediately when starting, pausing, or completing work
- **Liberal Task Creation**: Create tickets for ANY non-trivial work (>15 minutes estimated)
- **Frequent Board Activity**: User should see kanban changes throughout work sessions
- **Granular Tracking**: Break large tasks into smaller, trackable subtasks
- **Status Transparency**: Board status must reflect actual work state at all times

#### When Claude MUST Create New Issues
- **Feature Development**: Any new feature or enhancement work
- **Bug Fixes**: Any bug investigation or resolution work
- **Research Tasks**: Technical research, exploration, or analysis
- **Refactoring Work**: Code cleanup, optimization, or restructuring
- **Documentation**: Writing or updating documentation
- **Testing**: Creating or updating tests
- **Configuration**: Environment, deployment, or setup changes
- **Subtasks**: Breaking down complex work into manageable pieces

#### Required Status Update Triggers
- **Work Start**: Move ticket to `status: in-progress` when beginning work
- **Work Pause**: Comment with current progress when pausing/switching tasks
- **Blocking Issues**: Update status and comment when blocked or waiting
- **Work Complete**: Move to `status: review` or `status: done` immediately
- **Scope Changes**: Update ticket description when scope or approach changes
- **New Discoveries**: Create new tickets for discovered work

#### Project Board Commands (Claude Must Use Frequently)
```bash
# REQUIRED: Mark task as in-progress when starting work
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwHOAhw3ec4A73sX --id ITEM_ID --field-id PVTSSF_lAHOAhw3ec4A73sXzgwCjN0 --single-select-option-id 47fc9ee4

# REQUIRED: Mark task as done when completing work  
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwHOAhw3ec4A73sX --id ITEM_ID --field-id PVTSSF_lAHOAhw3ec4A73sXzgwCjN0 --single-select-option-id 98236657

# REQUIRED: Create new task for any non-trivial work
gh issue create --title "Task Title" --body "Description" --label "area: [work-stream],status: in-progress,iteration: current"

# REQUIRED: Add new tasks to project board immediately
gh project item-add 5 --owner chriswingler --url https://github.com/chriswingler/wildfire-cli/issues/ISSUE_NUMBER

# REQUIRED: Update task status when work state changes
gh issue comment ISSUE_NUMBER "Progress update: [current status and next steps]"

# REQUIRED: Close completed tasks with summary
gh issue close ISSUE_NUMBER --comment "Completed: [summary of work done and results]"
```

#### Board Activity Expectations
- **Multiple Updates Per Session**: 3-5 board updates during typical work session
- **Granular Task Breakdown**: Large tasks broken into 2-4 hour chunks
- **Progress Comments**: Regular progress updates on in-progress tickets
- **Immediate Status Changes**: No delay between work state and board state
- **Proactive Task Creation**: Create tickets before starting work, not after

#### Status Field Reference
- **Todo Status ID**: `f75ad846` (purple - ready to start)
- **In Progress Status ID**: `47fc9ee4` (yellow - currently working)  
- **Done Status ID**: `98236657` (green - completed work)
- **Project ID**: `PVT_kwHOAhw3ec4A73sX` (Wildfire CLI Kanban Board)
- **Status Field ID**: `PVTSSF_lAHOAhw3ec4A73sXzgwCjN0` (Status field)

#### Real-time Board Management Examples
```bash
# Starting work on a feature
gh issue create --title "Implement fire spread algorithm optimization" --label "area: game-engine,status: in-progress,iteration: current"
gh project item-add 5 --owner chriswingler --url https://github.com/chriswingler/wildfire-cli/issues/NEW_ISSUE

# Discovering additional work needed
gh issue create --title "Add unit tests for fire spread optimization" --label "area: game-engine,status: todo,iteration: current"

# Completing work with detailed summary
gh issue close 123 --comment "Completed: Fire spread algorithm optimized. Performance improved by 40%. All tests passing. Ready for deployment."

# Moving to next task
gh project item-edit --project-id PVT_kwHOAhw3ec4A73sX --id NEXT_ITEM_ID --field-id PVTSSF_lAHOAhw3ec4A73sXzgwCjN0 --single-select-option-id 47fc9ee4
```

**RESULT: User will see live kanban board activity as Claude works, providing complete transparency into development progress and current focus areas.**

#### Bidirectional Kanban Interaction - MANDATORY

**CRITICAL: Claude MUST detect and respond to user-initiated board changes**

#### Session Startup Board Assessment
- **REQUIRED**: Check current board state at the start of every work session
- **REQUIRED**: Compare board state with previous session expectations
- **REQUIRED**: Acknowledge any user changes, moves, or reorganizations
- **REQUIRED**: Ask for clarification when user changes impact planned work
- **REQUIRED**: Adapt work priorities based on user board manipulation

#### Detecting User Signals Through Board Changes
Claude must recognize these user communication patterns:

**User Moves Task to "In Progress"**: 
- User is requesting Claude work on this task immediately
- Claude should acknowledge and either start work or explain any blockers

**User Moves Task Between Columns**: 
- User is signaling priority or status changes
- Claude should acknowledge the change and adjust planning accordingly

**User Edits Task Description/Title**:
- User is changing scope, requirements, or approach
- Claude should read changes and confirm understanding

**User Adds Comments to Tasks**:
- User is providing guidance, feedback, or new requirements
- Claude should respond to comments and incorporate feedback

**User Changes Task Labels/Iteration**:
- User is reorganizing priorities or sprint planning
- Claude should acknowledge and adapt work planning

#### Required User Change Response Patterns
```bash
# REQUIRED: Check board state at session start
gh project item-list 5 --owner chriswingler --format json | jq -r '.items[] | select(.status == "In Progress") | .content.title'

# REQUIRED: Acknowledge user priority changes
gh issue comment ISSUE_NUMBER "Acknowledged: User moved this task to high priority. Adjusting work plan accordingly."

# REQUIRED: Respond to user task assignments
gh issue comment ISSUE_NUMBER "Starting work: User moved this task to in-progress. Beginning implementation now."

# REQUIRED: Confirm scope changes
gh issue comment ISSUE_NUMBER "Scope update noted: [summarize user changes]. Confirming new approach: [plan]."
```

#### Collaborative Decision Making Through Board State
The kanban board becomes a communication channel where:

**User Actions Signal Intent**:
- Moving task up in priority = "work on this next"
- Moving task to in-progress = "start this now"  
- Editing description = "change approach or scope"
- Adding comments = "here's guidance or feedback"
- Changing iteration = "this belongs in different sprint"

**Claude Responses Confirm Understanding**:
- Acknowledge user changes immediately
- Ask clarifying questions when changes create conflicts
- Provide status updates on user-requested work
- Suggest alternatives when user requests conflict with technical constraints
- Keep user informed about impact of their changes

#### Session Startup Workflow Example
```bash
# 1. Check for any in-progress tasks (user may have moved something)
gh project item-list 5 --owner chriswingler --format json | jq '.items[] | select(.fieldValues[] | select(.field.name == "Status" and .name == "In Progress"))'

# 2. Check for recent comments or changes
gh issue list --state open --limit 10 --json number,title,updatedAt,comments

# 3. Acknowledge any user changes found
gh issue comment ISSUE_NUMBER "Session startup: Detected user changes to board. Adapting work plan to prioritize user-moved tasks."

# 4. Proceed with work based on current board state
```

#### User Communication Examples

**Scenario 1: User moves task to "In Progress"**
- Claude: "Detected: User moved 'Fix Discord embed formatting' to in-progress. Starting work on this task immediately."
- Claude: Creates implementation subtasks, updates progress, completes work

**Scenario 2: User edits task description** 
- Claude: "Scope change detected: User updated requirements for mobile responsiveness. New approach: [summarized plan]. Proceeding with updated implementation."

**Scenario 3: User changes iteration labels**
- Claude: "Sprint reorganization detected: User moved 3 tasks from Sprint 5 to current iteration. Adjusting capacity planning and work priorities."

**RESULT: True collaborative project management where user and Claude communicate through board state changes, creating seamless workflow coordination.**
